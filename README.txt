## Program Details ##

This program will allow you to view it's current dynamic memory usage (as a graphed percentage of the total physical memory available),
as well as manipulate it using 3 different buttons: Allocate, Deallocate, and Leak. They each do as their names would imply, with allocations
and deallocations being performed at 100MB per button click. Leaking memory will cause all of the memory that is currently dynamically
allocated by this program to be "abandoned", as in put in a state where it is still allocated, but can no longer be controlled by this program.
The "Active" bar graph represents how much memory this program currently has control over, while the "Total" bar graph represents all the
program's dynamically allocated memory. Both are percentages based on the total physical memory available for the program to use.
Note: Generally speaking, memory leaks are a thing to be avoided at all costs when creating a program, as it normally takes
a full restart of the software to be undone. I have implemented an intentional way to cause a memory leak in this program,
but only for the purposes of demonstrating my understanding of the subject, and to show the importance of avoiding it. I do not intend
for this program to make it seem like a good thing, and I intend to avoid having that happen in all other cases (just as I did for the other
dynamic allocation and deallocation functions).

## Disclaimer ##

This program is a demo. While I am able to create software that actually has real world value, that is not what this one is for.
This program is strictly intended to serve as a way for me to showcase my skills as a software developer. Due to the fact how I am self-taught,
I am not able to provide any credentials/certifications that would need to be obtained from a third party, so I hope you will
accept this instead.

## Licensing Restrictions ##

This program (and it's source code) is licensed under a custom license I have created specifically for these demo programs. Under this licence,
the following rules are in effect:
- Allowed: Running this software on your own device, building it's code, using it's code to verify it's legitamacy, making custom modifications
to the code (as long as you do not publish the results, or use them to make money)
- Not Allowed: Publishing or sharing this program (or any part of it, with the exception of directing others to the offical links I provide),
using this program to make money in any way (includes using it in your buisiness, selling it to others, or any other action that allows you to
recieve currency or other valubles involving this software), making changes to this program's code, then publishing/sharing
the modified code with others, or monetizing your modified version of the software.
